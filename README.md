# Link Management System
Welcome to the README for my Link Management System that's written in React, making use of Google's Firebase.
## Objectives
As I move to a serverless architecture entirely, I need to replace my link shortener.  This solution will provide the following:
 - Act as a "landing page" for all my social links - almost a "mini CV"
 - Provide the backend API for shortening links with ShareX
 - Provide a frontend interface for updating social links and adding new short links with custom slugs
 - Authenticate requests with Firebase Authorization
 - Be completely serverless - the backend should *only* be Firebase and the frontend portion should be able to run smoothly on any server host or CDN
